## Installation
 * Set up Asp.Net Core to work with your system of choice - [Instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=aspnetcore2x) 
 * Download the latest release of Teknik for your system - [Releases](https://git.teknik.io/Teknikode/Teknik/releases)
 * Copy the files to your local web root directory.
 * Create a `ConnectionStrings.config` file in the `App_Data` directory and fill it with the following template and put in your SQL server connection details.

  ```nohighlight
  <connectionStrings>
    <add name="TeknikEntities"
      providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"
      connectionString="<Sql Server Connection String>" />
  </connectionStrings>
  ```

  * After the first run, a `Config.json` file will be created in the `App_Data` directory. This will need to be edited with your configuration options.

That's it, installation complete! If you're having problems, let us know through the [Contact](https://contact.teknik.io/) page.
